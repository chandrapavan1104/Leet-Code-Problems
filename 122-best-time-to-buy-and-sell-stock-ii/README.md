<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/">122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>You are given an integer array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.</p>

<p>On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold <strong>at most one</strong> share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the <strong>same day</strong>.</p>

<p>Find and return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> profit you can achieve</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<div class="top-box hide"><div class="alert-info"></div></div><pre data-original-code="Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<div class="top-box hide"><div class="alert-info"></div></div><pre data-original-code="Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
